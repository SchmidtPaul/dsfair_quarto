This chapter is a collection of things I wish I had known earlier in my years using R and that I hope can be of use to you. Sections are named after R packages or whatever applies and sorted alphabetically.

# {broom} - tidy formatted results

In R, results from statistical tests, models etc. are often formatted in a way that may not be optimal for further processing steps. Luckily, [{broom}](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) will format the results of [the most common functions](https://broom.tidymodels.org/articles/available-methods.html) into [tidy data structures](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10).

         mtcars$disp)

# {dlookr} - descriptive statistics

When providing descriptive statistics tables, one may find the number of relevant measures become annoyingly large so that even with the {tidyverse}, several lines of code are necessary. Here are just five measures, and they are not even including the [`na.rm = TRUE`](https://www.statology.org/na-rm/) argument, which is necessary for data with missing values.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

PlantGrowth %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(weight),
    stddev = sd(weight),
    median = median(weight),
    min = min(weight),
    max = max(weight)
  )
```

Obviously, there are multiple packages who try to address just that. The one I've been using for some time now is [{dlookr}](https://choonghyunryu.github.io/dlookr/) with its `describe()` function. It actually provides more measures than I usually need[^1], but it has everything I want and I disregard the rest (via `select()`).

[^1]: Keep in mind that `p00` is the 0th percentile and thus the minimum. Analogously, `p50` is the median and `p100` the maximum.

```{r}
PlantGrowth %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  dlookr::describe(weight)
```

::: callout-note
It is intentional that I did not actually load the {dlookr} package, but instead used its \`describe()\` function via the [packagename::functionname()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35240971/what-are-the-double-colons-in-r) method. This is because of a minor bug in the {dlookr} package described [here](https://github.com/choonghyunryu/dlookr/issues/79), which is only relevant if you are using the package with knitr/Rmarkdown/quarto. I am using quarto to generate this website and thus I avoid loading the package. This is fine for me, since I usually only need this one function one time during an analysis. It is also fine for you, since the code works the same way in a standard R script.

# {ggtext} - automatic word wrapping

Adding long text to plots created via {ggplot2} is problematic, since you have to insert line breaks yourself. However, [{ggext}](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/)'s `geom_textbox()` for data labels and `element_textbox_simple()` for title, caption etc. will automatically add line breaks:

```{r}
longtext <- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum."
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 3
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() +
  
  
  
  aes(y = 1, x = 1, label = longtext) +
  geom_label() +
  labs(caption = longtext)
```

        ) +
  aes(y = 1, x = 1, label = longtext) +
  geom_textbox() +
  labs(caption = longtext)

# %in% and %not_in%

R has the built-in function `%in%` which checks whether something is present in a vector.

```{r}
treatments <- c("Ctrl", "A", "B")
```

Not only can we checke which treatments are present in our `treatment` vector (left), but we can also easily keep only those that are (right).

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
c("A", "D") %in% treatments 
```
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
c("A", "D") %>% .[. %in% treatments]
```
:::
:::

Not built-in, for some reason, is the opposite of that function - checking whether something is **not** present. Yet, we can quickly built our own function that does exactly that:

```{r}
`%not_in%` <- Negate(`%in%`)
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
c("A", "D") %not_in% treatments 
```
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
c("A", "D") %>% .[. %not_in% treatments]
```
