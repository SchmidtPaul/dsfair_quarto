# Data

This example is taken from Chapter *"3.8 Analysis of an* $\alpha$-design" of the course material "Mixed models for metric data (3402-451)" by [Prof. Dr. Hans-Peter Piepho](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/organisation?tx_base_lsfcontentadmin%5BlsfPerson%5D=6257). It considers data published in @johnwilliams_1995 from a yield (t/ha) trial laid out as an alpha design. The trial had 24 genotypes (`gen`), 3 complete replicates (`rep`) and 6 incomplete blocks (`block`) within each replicate. The block size was 4.

## Import

The data is available as part of the {agridat} package and needs no further formatting:

```{r}
dat <- as_tibble(agridat::john.alpha)
dat
```

## Explore

We make use of [`dlookr::describe()`](../../misc/usefulthings.qmd#dlookr) to conveniently obtain descriptive summary tables. Here, we get can summarize per block and per cultivar.

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
dat %>% 
  group_by(gen) %>% 
  dlookr::describe(yield) %>% 
  select(2:n, mean, sd) %>%
  arrange(desc(n), desc(mean)) %>% 
  print(n = Inf)
```
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
dat %>% 
  group_by(rep, block) %>% 
  dlookr::describe(yield) %>% 
  select(2:n, mean, sd) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean)) %>% 
  print(n = Inf)
```
:::
:::

Additionally, we can decide to plot our data:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# sort genotypes by mean yield
gen_order <- dat %>% 
  group_by(gen) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(yield)) %>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  pull(gen) %>% 
  as.character()

ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(
    y = yield,
    x = gen,
    shape = rep
  ) +
  geom_line(
    aes(group = gen),
    color = "darkgrey"
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_discrete(
    name = "Genotype",
    limits = gen_order
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Yield",
    limits = c(0, NA),
    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))
  ) +
  scale_shape_discrete(
    name = "Block"
  ) +
  guides(shape = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top", 
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

Finally, since this is an experiment that was laid with a certain experimental design (= a non-resolvable augmented design) - it makes sense to also get a field plan. This can be done via `desplot()` from [{desplot}](../../misc/usefulthings.qmd#desplot).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
desplot(
  data = dat, 
  flip = TRUE, # row 1 on top, not on bottom
  form = gen ~ row + col | rep, # fill color per genotype, headers per replicate
  out1 = block, # lines between incomplete blocks
  out1.gpar = list(col = "black", lwd = 1, lty = "dashed"), # line type
  main = "Field layout", # title
  key.cex = 0.6,
  layout = c(3, 1) # force all reps drawn in one row
)
```

# Modelling

Finally, we can decide to fit a linear model with `yield` as the response variable and (fixed) `gen` and `block` effects. There also needs to be term for the 18 incomplete blocks (*i.e.* `rep:block`) in the model, but it can be taken either as a fixed or a random effect. Since our goal is to compare genotypes, we will determine which of the two models we prefer by comparing the average standard error of a difference (s.e.d.) for the comparisons between adjusted genotype means - the lower the s.e.d. the better.

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
# blocks as fixed (linear model)
mod.fb <- lm(yield ~ gen + rep +
               rep:block,
             data = dat)

mod.fb %>%
  emmeans(pairwise ~ "gen",
          adjust = "tukey") %>%
  pluck("contrasts") %>% # extract diffs
  as_tibble() %>% # format to table
  pull("SE") %>% # extract s.e.d. column
  mean() # get arithmetic mean
```
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
```{r}
# blocks as random (linear mixed model)
mod.rb <- lmer(yield ~ gen + rep +
                 (1 | rep:block),
               data = dat)

mod.rb %>%
  emmeans(pairwise ~ "gen",
          adjust = "tukey",
          lmer.df = "kenward-roger") %>%
  pluck("contrasts") %>% # extract diffs
  as_tibble() %>% # format to table
  pull("SE") %>% # extract s.e.d. column
  mean() # get arithmetic mean
```
:::
:::

As a result, we find that the model with random block effects has the smaller s.e.d. and is therefore more precise in terms of comparing genotypes.

## Model assumptions met? (click to show)

It would be at this moment (i.e. after fitting the model and before running the ANOVA), that you should check whether the model assumptions are met. Find out more in the [summary article "Model Diagnostics"](../../summaryarticles/modeldiagnostics.qmd)
:::

# ANOVA

Based on our model, we can then conduct an ANOVA:

```{r}
ANOVA <- anova(mod.rb, ddf = "Kenward-Roger")
ANOVA
```

Accordingly, the ANOVA's F-test found the cultivar effects to be statistically significant (`r getp(ANOVA, "gen")`).

# Mean comparison

Besides an ANOVA, one may also want to compare adjusted yield means between cultivars via post hoc tests (t-test, Tukey test etc.).

```{r}
mean_comp <- mod.rb %>% 
  emmeans(specs = ~ gen) %>% # adj. mean per genotype
  cld(adjust = "Tukey", Letters = letters) # compact letter display (CLD)

mean_comp
```

Note that if you would like to see the underlying individual contrasts/differences between adjusted means, simply add `details = TRUE` to the `cld()` statement. Furthermore, check out the [Summary Article "Compact Letter Display"](../../summaryarticles/compactletterdisplay.qmd).

Finally, we can create a plot that displays both the raw data and the results, *i.e.* the comparisons of the adjusted means that are based on the linear model.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# reorder genotype factor levels according to adjusted mean
my_caption <- "Black dots represent raw data. Red diamonds and error bars represent adjusted means with 95% confidence limits per cultivar. Means followed by a common letter are not significantly different according to the Tukey-test."

ggplot() +
  # green/red dots representing the raw data
  geom_point(
    data = dat,
    aes(y = yield, x = gen)
  ) +
  # red diamonds representing the adjusted means
  geom_point(
    data = mean_comp,
    aes(y = emmean, x = gen),
    shape = 18,
    color = "red",
    position = position_nudge(x = 0.2)
  ) +
  # red error bars representing the confidence limits of the adjusted means
  geom_errorbar(
    data = mean_comp,
    aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL, x = gen),
    color = "red",
    width = 0.1,
    position = position_nudge(x = 0.2)
  ) +
  # red letters 
  geom_text(
    data = mean_comp,
    aes(y = lower.CL, x = gen, label = str_trim(.group)),
    color = "red",
    angle = 90,
    hjust = 1.1,
    position = position_nudge(x = 0.2)
  ) + 
  scale_x_discrete(
    name = "Cultivar",
    limits = as.character(mean_comp$gen)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Yield",
    limits = c(0, NA),
    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))
  ) +
  labs(caption = my_caption) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.caption = element_textbox_simple(margin = margin(t = 5)),
        plot.caption.position = "plot",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))
```
