# DSFAIR

Data Science for Agriculture in R starts out as a step-by-step introduction to R while its later chapters are more of a cookbook with statistical analyses of typical examples in life sciences with focus on experimental agriculture, biology, ecology and other related fields.

This website is still under construction. I am trying to gather three of my older websites into this one (using quarto). The previous websites are still online: [CrashcouRse](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/crashcouRse/index.html), [DSFAIR](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/DSFAIR/) & [MMFAIR](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/MMFAIR/).
